The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 openra : Depends: xdg-utils but it is not going to be installed
 tshark : Depends: libpcap0.8 (>= 1.5.1) but it is not going to be installed
          Depends: libwireshark8 (>= 2.2.2) but it is not going to be installed
          Depends: libwiretap6 (>= 2.2.4) but it is not going to be installed
          Depends: libwsutil7 (>= 2.1.2) but it is not going to be installed
          Depends: wireshark-common (= 2.2.6+g32dac6a-2) but it is not going to be installed
