# Reference: https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucomm.htm
#  By default, comm produces three-column output:
#     Column 1 contains lines unique to FILE1.
#     Column 2 contains lines unique to FILE2.
#     Column 3 contains lines common to both files.
#  Columns are separated by TAB.
# Use options(1,2,3) to SUPRESS column.

# This command will suppress columns 1 and 2. Therefore, display only column 3.
	comm -12 FILE_1.txt FILE_2.txt

# Line unique to FILE2
	comm -3 "${old_file}" "${new_file}" | grep -P '^\t' | tr -d '\t' > out.diff
