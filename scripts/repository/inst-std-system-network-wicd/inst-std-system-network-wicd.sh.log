You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 projectlibre : Depends: openjdk-7-jre but it is not going to be installed or
                         openjdk-6-jre but it is not installable or
                         openjdk-8-jre but it is not going to be installed or
                         sun-java6-jre but it is not installable or
                         java7-runtime or
                         java6-runtime or
