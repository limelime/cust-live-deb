The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ant : Depends: default-jre-headless but it is not going to be installed or
                java5-runtime-headless or
                java6-runtime-headless or
                java7-runtime-headless
 projectlibre : Depends: openjdk-7-jre but it is not going to be installed or
                         openjdk-6-jre but it is not installable or
                         openjdk-8-jre but it is not going to be installed or
                         sun-java6-jre but it is not installable or
                         java7-runtime or
                         java6-runtime or
                         java8-runtime
