 conky : Depends: conky-std but it is not going to be installed or
                  conky-cli but it is not going to be installed or
                  conky-all but it is not going to be installed
 google-chrome-stable : Depends: gconf-service but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: libgconf-2-4 (>= 2.31.1) but it is not going to be installed
                        Depends: libxss1 but it is not going to be installed
